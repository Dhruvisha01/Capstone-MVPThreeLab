## Getting Started

Once you clone the repo, here's how to get the code up and running.

1. Make sure you have node.js installed in your computer. If you don't, you can install it by following the instructions on this link - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

2. Once the installation is complete and you have cloned the repository you need install all the packages used in this code. To do that, in your terminal/ command prompt, copy and paste the following line of code to download all the node_modules used.
```bash
npm install i
```
3. The next step is to run the project on localhost using the following command in your terminal/ command prompt
```bash
npx vite
```
4. (Optional) If you need to run the lab on your phone through the localhost you need to type in the following command instead
```bash
npx vite --host
```
5. Your terminal should now give you a localhost URL where your project is running. Click on the URL to open the project and view the lab
